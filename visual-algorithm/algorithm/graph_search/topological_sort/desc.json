  "拓扑排序": "Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG. NOTE: when the graph is represented as an Adjacency Matrix, the Calculation of in-degree Array becomes O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)",
