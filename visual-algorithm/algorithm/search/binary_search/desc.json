  "二分法查找": "Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by comparing the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the lower or upper half of the array is eliminated depending on the result and the search is repeated in the remaining subarray until it is successful.",
